Subject: Application for BA/PA/MA: Communication mechanisms in Multi-Agent Systems via OPC UA

Dear Mr. Werthmann,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the thesis/project position regarding the development of communication mechanisms for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) based on OPC UA in the Distributed Production (DPC) factory. The challenge of enabling autonomous, near real-time energy coordination in highly flexible production environments aligns perfectly with my academic interests and practical coding experience.

To demonstrate my proactive approach and capability for this specific topic, I have independently developed a prototypical Python architecture that simulates the core requirements of your project description. 

You can review the conceptual prototype on my GitHub here:

### Prototype Overview:
I designed a decentralized MAS using Python’s `asyncua` library. The architecture features:
*   **Dual-Role Agents:** Specialized entities (Consumer, Producer, Storage) that each run an asynchronous OPC UA Server to expose their semantic Information Model (e.g., `CurrentPowerDemand`, `StateOfCharge`).
*   **Pub/Sub Event-Driven Communication:** Utilizing asyncua data-change notifications, agents dynamically subscribe to one another's continuous output without inefficient polling.
*   **Autonomous Decision Logic:** A Storage Agent actively monitors the grid balance (Generation vs. Demand) across peer nodes via OPC UA to autonomously toggle between charging and discharging states.

This initial experiment allowed me to tackle the practical complexities of OPC UA object typing and asynchronous network programming. I am confident that these existing skills in Python and standard industry communication protocols provide a strong foundation to hit the ground running on the deeper scientific evaluation and modelling required for the FAPS DC factory project.

I have attached my CV and current transcript of records for your consideration. I am highly motivated to contribute to this research area and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my prototype and the thesis objectives with you in person.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
