Subject: Application for BA/PA/MA: Communication mechanisms in Multi-Agent Systems via OPC UA

Dear Mr. Werthmann,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the thesis/project position regarding the development of communication mechanisms for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) based on OPC UA in the Distributed Production (DPC) factory. The challenge of enabling autonomous, near real-time energy coordination in highly flexible production environments aligns perfectly with my academic interests and practical coding experience.

To realistically prepare for the technical requirements of this thesis, I independently built a prototypical Python "sandbox" to familiarize myself with the `asyncua` library and the core concepts of Multi-Agent Systems. My goal was to proactively tackle the communication infrastructure before the actual project begins.

You can review this conceptual prototype on my GitHub here:

### Prototype Overview:
This sandbox implements a decentralized MAS where specialized agents (Consumer, Producer, Storage) act as both async OPC UA Servers and Clients. Using asyncua's Pub/Sub data-change notifications, the agents dynamically subscribe to one another's continuous output without inefficient polling. 

Currently, the agents use simple deterministic logic (e.g., the Storage Agent passively charges when generation exceeds demand). However, having this robust communication layer already built and tested means I am ready to hit the ground running on the actual core of the thesis: implementing advanced AI and negotiation algorithms (such as Contract Net Protocols) on top of these agents.

This initial experiment allowed me to tackle the practical complexities of OPC UA object typing and asynchronous network programming. I am confident that these existing skills provide a strong foundation to focus deeply on the scientific evaluation and modelling required for the FAPS DC factory project.

I have attached my CV and current transcript of records for your consideration. I am highly motivated to contribute to this research area and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my prototype and the thesis objectives with you in person.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
